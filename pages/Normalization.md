Normalization is a scaling technique in which values are **shifted and rescaled so that they end up ranging between 0 and 1.** It is also known as Min-Max scaling.

Hereâ€™s the formula for normalization:
$$X^{'}=\frac{X-X_{m i n}}{X_{m a x}-X_{m i n}}$$

Not to be confused with [Standarization](Standarization.md)

- I want to create my own todo app to solve the following problems that current todo apps dont tackle:
 - Sequential subtasks
 - Routines (set timer after task completion for reminder of next task)
 ## Tech stack
 Backend with pocketBase (simple and fast)
 Frontend with React Native so we have mobile apps
 ## Backend
 Tables:
 * User
  * Project
  * Task
  * Subtask

The bias error is an error from **erroneous assumptions** in the learning algorithm.

For example, [[Linear regression]] assumes a **linear relationship** between the features and the response, but in **reality**, the relationship is often **curvilinear**. A high ‚è´ bias model is most likely to [Underfit](Underfitting.md) the training data.

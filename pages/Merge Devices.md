To try to merge the devices I use I'm trying to create a ecosystem tackling the following problems.
## Clipboard Sharing
There are a couple of options
* [[Join]] (what i used to use)
* [[KDE Connect]] (what im using)

## File Share
aka. sending a file *once* from one device to another.
* [[Join]] (what i used to use)
* [[KDE Connect]] (what im using)
* Email (boho)
* OneDrive
## File Sync
Keep a file in many places at once
 [[SyncThing]] (+completely  automatic. - peer to peer-> devices must be concurrent)
 Github (+ has version tracking - must do push pull)

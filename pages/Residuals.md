[[Q-Q plot]] -> Normality of residuals

# Plot
```r

## Good
Normal residuals 
No patters in forecast or factors -> Flat line
## Bad

Clear pattern
 U â‡¾ Quadratic fit would be better for that feature

> Funnel â‡¾ not homogeneous variance of residuals

Histogram not normal / Line with weight bottom -> Non-normal residuals

See cif res are corr with X2
if no interaction

A hyperplane is a plane of n -1 dimension that separates the n dimensional feature space of the observations into two spaces.
For example, the hyperplane in a two-dimensional feature space is a line, and a surface in a three-dimensional feature space.


In a n-dimensional space, a hyperplane is a flat affine subspace of dimension n-1, given by
$$
\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x_{1}+\beta_{2}x_{2}+\cdots\sharp\beta_{n}x_{n}=0
$$
In **two** dimensions, a hyperplane is a flat one-dimensional  ubspace, in other words a **line**, given by
$$
\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x_{1}+\beta_{2}x_{2}=0
$$
In **three** dimensions it is a **plane**:
$$
\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x_{1}+\beta_{2}x_{2}+\beta_{3}x_{3}=0
$$

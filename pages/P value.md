# What is the p-value?
The p-value is the probability of observing a test statistic at least as extreme as the one observed, given that the null hypothesis is true. The p-value is a measure of the strength of the evidence against the null hypothesis. 

# How to interpret the p-value
The smaller the p-value, the stronger the evidence against the null hypothesis. 

In Linear regression models, the p-value is the probability of we needing that parameter not being zero. 

If the p-value is less than 0.05, we can say the coefficient is **statistically significant.**
If the p-value is large, we can say that the parameter **not significant** and if significantly large it may be omitted.
